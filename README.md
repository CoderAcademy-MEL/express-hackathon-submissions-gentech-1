2. Clone the forked repo, it should now be associated with your account

3. Chuck your express project directory into the root of this repo, delete your `.git` directory

4. Create a branch, call it `<your-name>-express-app`

5. `git add .` and `git commit` in that branch

6. `git push origin <branch-name>`

7. Submit a pull request on github
